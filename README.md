# callouts: put notes inside a picture

This LaTeX package enables to define the _annotation_ environment, in which callouts, notes, arrows, and the like can be placed to describe certain parts of the picture. _annotation_ opens a TikZ environment and certain often re-occurring commands are summarized as custom commands. A grid can be displayed to aid the placement of annotations. The so placed annotations remain in the same position if the picture scale is changed, while the font size is kept constant. A global color scheme for the annotations can also be defined via an option.

This directory contains the following files:
